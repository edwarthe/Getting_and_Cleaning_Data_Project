Peer Assessments / Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
===========================================================
  
This is the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. It consists in create tidy data that can be used for later analysis. For grading it is required to submit:  
  
1. A tidy data set  
2. A link to a Github repository with scripts for performing the analysis  
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data (CodeBook.md)  
4. A README.md in the repo.  

The data for the project is here 
[Data project](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)  

The R script run_analysis.R does the following:   
  
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.  
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
